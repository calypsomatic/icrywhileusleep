but even so, the stereotype about anyone with certain food requirements or restrictions, is that they can&#039;t shut up about it.  But in my case, I just want
to eat what I eat and not eat what I don&#039;t eat and go on with my life, but it&#039;s inevitable that in some dining situation my food preferences will arise,
just out of plain logistics, or, in situations such as that depicted here, when people realize that I&#039;m eating some kind of vegetarian-like food.  And in
my experience, it&#039;s then the person with the normal or non-restricted diet that has to talk about it.  I just want everyone to eat what they eat and not eat
what they don&#039;t eat and talk about something a bit more interesting.  Like worms!  Did you know there is a species of jumping worms - they actually jump! -
that are an invasive species?'}]
