Just your daily reminder that other people don&#039;t exist FOR you, to serve as your foil for self-fulfillment or whatever.
2. Thinking or telling someone they&#039;re cool, interesting, fun, and so forth is great and all, but that alone does not constitute a reason for them to hang out with you/be your friend/date you/love you back. Relationships can&#039;t be founded on compliments alone; even insecure people don&#039;t want to hang out with people that don&#039;t also pique their interest, even if those other people think highly of them. Saying, &#039;hey you&#039;re awesome!&#039; is not an effective way of procuring a real friendship. 
3. Returning to point #1, manic pixie dream girls are not for you. They&#039;re for me. I want them. They&#039;re mine.'}]
