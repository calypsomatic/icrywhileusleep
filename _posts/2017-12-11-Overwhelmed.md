This is the best I could do for a comic under those circumstances and I don&#039;t know if there will be one next week.  Even just trying to think about making a comic sends me into a spiral of deep doubt about whether I want to do it at all or why or what am I even doing with my life.  Luckily I was able to condense this down into a totally digestible cutesy comic that doesn't even remotely address any of the thoughts and concerns I am inundated with, so, you&#039;re welcome.'}]
